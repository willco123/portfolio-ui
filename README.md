Built using NextJS 13 app-router, a meta-framework for the React library, along with Tailwind CSS.

Utilising bleeding-edge features such as server-side rendered components for better SEO and parallel/intercepting routes for modals.

Responsive design was a core challenge of this project, with custom animations using Key Frames and themes defined in Tailwind's config. Additionally, to ensure a seamless user experience, I utilized script injection techniques to prevent the occurrence of the 'Flash of Unstyled Content' (FOUC).

Finally I experimented with OBS/FFmpeg for generating GIFS and thumbnails, along with GIMP and Inkscape for designing custom decals.

Deployed on Vercel.
