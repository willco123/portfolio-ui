A **Full-stack Developer** with a drive to continuously learn and leverage my skills to craft innovative solutions for complex problems.
I am passionate about technology and have been exploring
this through software development for just over two years.

My focus has been on web development, utilizing technologies like TypeScript with React on the Nodejs runtime for development. Achieving responsive design with SASS/TailwindCSS and improving the UX with custom SVG's and GIFs made with Inkscape and Ffmpeg.

On the back-end, I've explored various database technologies, including MongoDB and PostgreSQL, often using ORMs like Mongoose and pg. Express is my go-to framework for efficient route handling. I prioritize robustness through rigorous testing, employing technologies like Jest and Playwright.

Delving into DevOps, I've explored bundling, code-splitting, and lazy loading using webpack. Custom TypeScript/Jest configurations to suite my development styles and needs. My deployment expertise extends to platforms like Vercel, Render, and Netlify, ensuring seamless application delivery.
